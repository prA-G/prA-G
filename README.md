### :rocket: About Me
:snake: I'm currently focused on learning **Python for Data Science**, building a strong foundation in:
:white_check_mark: Python Basics (variables, loops, conditionals)
:bricks: Data Structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples)
:hammer_and_wrench: Functions & Modules (writing clean and reusable code)
:male-teacher: Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects, inheritance)
:bar_chart: I'm also learning tools like **ML** and **NLP** and **SQL** to bring data to life through analysis and visualization
:books: My GitHub is where I track my growth through hands-on practice and mini-projects
:speech_balloon: I enjoy simplifying data and explaining concepts clearly — feel free to connect!



* :snake: Python (basics, data structures, functions, OOP & more)
* :abacus: SQL & Statistics for data handling and analysis
* :bar_chart: Power BI & Excel for data visualization and reporting

* Work on real-world data problems
* Keep learning and growing with a data-driven team
If you’re hiring, mentoring, or just love talking data — let’s connect! :handshake:
